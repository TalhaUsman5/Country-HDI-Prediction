# My Machine Learning Journey: Principles, Projects, and Progress

This repository documents my ongoing journey in machine learning. It serves as a foundational hub for everything I learn and build, as I continue to develop algorithms and sharpen my skills in this dynamic field.

## 🌟 Features

- Automated data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical variables).  
-  classification models for churn prediction (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
- Evaluation metrics for model performance (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).  
- Modular design using `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.

## 📊 Data

The datasets used for these algorithms can be downloaded manually or by executing the jupyter file.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (3.8 or above)  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn
- Pipeline
- ColumnTransformer
- RandomizedSearchCv

## 🚀 Usage

- **Train the Model**:  
   Run the script or notebook to preprocess the data and train the model:  
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
