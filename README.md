## 🌟 Features

- Automated data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical variables).  
- classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
- Evaluation metrics for model performance (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).  
- Modular design using `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.

## 🚀 Usage

- **Train the Model**:  
   Run the script or notebook to preprocess the data and train the model:  
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
