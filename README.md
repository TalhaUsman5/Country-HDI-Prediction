# Country HDI Prediction: Machine Learning Project

This repository is dedicated to predicting the Human Development Index (HDI) of countries using machine learning techniques. It contains all stages of the ML workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation, with a focus on building interpretable and effective regression models for HDI prediction.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Automated data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables).
- Regression models for HDI prediction (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc.).
- Evaluation metrics for regression performance (Mean Squared Error, R² Score).
- Modular design using `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning.
- Visualizations for data exploration and model results.

---

## 📊 Data

The dataset includes country-level indicators relevant to HDI. You can download the dataset manually or by running the notebook.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Pipeline
- ColumnTransformer
- GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV

## 🚀 Usage

- **Run the Notebook**:  
   Open and execute `Country-HDI-Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.
